## Sample Project

### Database Setup

Running the sample project requires creating a new Xperience by Kentico database. To create a database follow the instructions in the Xperience documentation on [creating a new database](https://docs.kentico.com/developers-and-admins/installation#create-the-project-database). Don't forget to update connection string in appsettings.json if neccessary.

### Kentico Setup

To demonstrate the functionality on the Dancing Goat page, it is neccessary to create (See [Managing search indexes](Managing-Indexes.md)) 2 demo indices with names advanced and simple. Without these two indices, search on the live page will always fail.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch with one of the following prefixes

   - `feat/` - for new functionality
   - `refactor/` - for restructuring of existing features
   - `fix/` - for bugfixes

1. Run `dotnet format` against the `XperienceCommunity.MicrosoftExchange` solution

   > use `.NET: format (Microsoft Exchange)` VS Code task.

1. Commit changes, with a commit message preferably following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) convention.

1. Once ready, create a PR on GitHub. The PR will need to have all comments resolved and all tests passing before it will be merged.

   - The PR should have a helpful description of the scope of changes being contributed.
   - Include screenshots or video to reflect UX or UI updates
   - Indicate if new settings need to be applied when the changes are merged - locally or in other environments
